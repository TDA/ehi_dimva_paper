TOTAL FEEDBACK:

Reviewer 1
-

- Table 1 conveys information that would be better summarized briefly in the
body of the paper, or omitted altogether.

- ~~Figures 2 and 3 convey identical information, so one of them can be omitted.~~

- Section 3.2.1 is far too large (to the point of being self-referential), and
ought to be divided into smaller sub-sections.

- Section 6 contains what appears to be a phantom footnote (2).

- Typos: abstract: "E-mail Header Injection vulnerability" -> "E-mail header
injection"; p.1: "made it possible" -> "makes it possible"; p.3: "vulnerability
on the web" -> "vulnerabilities on the web"; p.4: "be allow" -> "allow"; p.6:
"vulnerability: (1)" -> "vulnerabilities: (1)"; p.7: "on overall" -> "on the
overall"; p.8: "CMS'" -> "CMSes"; several times: "alexa" -> "Alexa"

Reviewer 2

- E-mail -> email 
- some text is smaller than the rest, like “tobozo” and email addresses.
- Text in multiple places goes out of bounds, like in Section 2.3
- In Figure 1 the term “URLs” is used instead of websites. For example,
there are no URLs that have forms.
- to header -> To header
- [7] gives a 404 HTTP error

Reviewer 3
-

- Section 4.3.2 could be a bit more detailed. While the choice of languages is
interesting, it would have also been interesting to see whether the
vulnerabilities could be associated to popular or outdated software projects.
E.g. a certain Wordpress plugin that is vulnerable or a certain version of a
popular blog or e-commerce software. - Interestingly, I remember some version of the paper containing this exact thing.

- ~~Some sentences were hard to read for me due to some grammar issues. The paper
could benefit from proof reading by a native English speaker.~~ Uhm, sure, lol. Says the guy who wrote "associated to" right above. :\
