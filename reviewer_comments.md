TOTAL FEEDBACK:

Reviewer 1
-

- Table 1 conveys information that would be better summarized briefly in the
body of the paper, or omitted altogether.

- ~~Figures 2 and 3 convey identical information, so one of them can be omitted.~~

- Section 3.2.1 is far too large (to the point of being self-referential), and
ought to be divided into smaller sub-sections.

- Section 6 contains what appears to be a phantom footnote (2).

- Typos: abstract: "E-mail Header Injection vulnerability" -> "E-mail header
injection"; p.1: "made it possible" -> "makes it possible"; p.3: "vulnerability
on the web" -> "vulnerabilities on the web"; p.4: "be allow" -> "allow"; p.6:
"vulnerability: (1)" -> "vulnerabilities: (1)"; p.7: "on overall" -> "on the
overall"; p.8: "CMS'" -> "CMSes"; several times: "alexa" -> "Alexa"
