\subsection{Analysis of Vulnerable domains}

We performed the following analyses on the vulnerable domains:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Checking Alexa rankings of the vulnerable domains.
	\item Investigating the back-end languages used by the vulnerable domains.
	\item Analyzing the presence of DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), SPF (Sender Policy Framework), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \& Conformance) mechanisms on these domains.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Alexa rankings of vulnerable domains.}
We searched through the Alexa rankings data\cite{alexa} for the domains that were found to be vulnerable, and found 135 of these domains in the top 1 million ranked websites. A detailed distribution of the rankings is shown in Table~\ref{tab:alexa} / Figure~\ref{fig:alexa_data_bar} / Figure~\ref{fig:alexa_data_pie}.

%TODO Adam: Need to decide if table or graph, if graph, then Pie vs Bar.
